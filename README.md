# Basics-on-Numpy

**NumPy** -

NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.
It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it 
freely.
NumPy stands for Numerical Python.

Numpy array - 
A numpy array is a grid of values, all of the same type, and is indexed by a tuple of nonnegative 
integers. The number of dimensions is the rank of the array; the shape of an array is a tuple of 
integers giving the size of the array along each dimension.

Array indexing -
Numpy offers several ways to index into arrays like slicing, Integer array indexing and Boolean 
array indexing

Array math - 
Basic mathematical functions operate element wise on arrays, and are available both as 
operator overloads and as functions in the numpy module
